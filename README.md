Zerodha Clone – Full Stack Web Application
A full-stack Zerodha-inspired web application developed as a major project.
The project demonstrates a modern trading platform interface with separate frontend, dashboard, and backend applications.

📌 Project Overview
This project is a clone/inspired version of the Zerodha trading platform.

It is developed using:

React.js for the frontend and dashboard
Node.js and Express.js for the backend
MongoDB for database management
Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
Axios for API communication
React Router for navigation
Chart.js for displaying charts and market-related data
Material UI for dashboard components
The application is divided into three main parts:

Frontend – Landing page and user-facing website
Dashboard – Trading dashboard interface
Backend – REST API and database operations

⚙️ Requirements
Before running this project, make sure the following software is installed:
1. Node.js
Download and install Node.js from:
https://nodejs.org/
Check the installation:
node -v
npm -v

2. Git
Install Git from:
https://git-scm.com/
Check the installation:
git --version

3. MongoDB
You need a MongoDB database for the backend.
You can use:
- MongoDB Atlas
- Local MongoDB installation
Make sure you have a MongoDB connection string.
Example:
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/zerodha

📥 Installation
Step 1 – Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/Ayushman-Sahoo/zerodha-clone.git

Move into the project directory:
cd zerodha-clone

🔧 Step 2 – Setup Backend
Open a terminal inside the project folder.
Run:
cd backend

Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Environment Variables
Create a .env file inside the backend folder.
Example:
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=3000

Replace:
your_mongodb_connection_string

with your actual MongoDB connection string.
Important
Do not upload your .env file to GitHub.
The project already contains a .gitignore file to prevent environment files and node_modules from being uploaded.
▶️ Step 3 – Start Backend
Inside the backend folder, run:
npm start

or, if the project uses nodemon:
npm run dev

The backend server will start on the configured port.
For example:
http://localhost:3000

💻 Step 4 – Setup Dashboard
Open a new terminal.
From the project root:
cd dashboard

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the dashboard:
npm start

The dashboard will normally run on:
http://localhost:3001

If another port is configured by your React application, use the port shown in the terminal.
🌐 Step 5 – Setup Frontend
Open another terminal.
From the project root:
cd frontend

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the frontend:
npm start

The frontend will normally run on:
http://localhost:3000

If the port is already being used, React may automatically ask to run the application on another available port.
🔄 Running the Complete Project
To run the complete application, you need to run the three parts separately.
Terminal 1 – Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Terminal 2 – Dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install
npm start

Terminal 3 – Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Keep all three terminals running while using the application.
🔌 Backend API
The backend provides REST APIs that allow the dashboard to communicate with the database.
Some of the main API operations include:
Get Holdings
GET /allHoldings

Used to retrieve holdings data.
Add Holdings
POST /addHoldings

Used to add holdings information to the database.
Create Order
POST /newOrder

Used to create a new order.
🗄️ Database
The project uses MongoDB to store application data.
Mongoose is used to define and manage database schemas.
The application contains data models related to areas such as:
- Holdings
- Positions
- Orders
The backend connects to MongoDB using the connection string stored in the environment variables.
🔐 Security
Sensitive information should never be directly written inside the source code.
For example:
MongoDB username
MongoDB password
API keys
Secret keys
Environment variables

These values should be stored inside .env files.
Example:
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

The .env file should not be committed to GitHub.
🚫 Files Ignored by Git
The project uses .gitignore to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being uploaded.
Examples include:
node_modules/
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.production
build/
dist/
*.log

This keeps the GitHub repository clean and prevents sensitive configuration from being exposed.
🐛 Troubleshooting
1. npm install is not working
Make sure Node.js and npm are installed:
node -v
npm -v

Then run:
npm install

2. MongoDB connection error
Check:
- MongoDB is running
- MongoDB connection string is correct
- Username and password are correct
- Network access is configured if using MongoDB Atlas
- .env file is present in the backend directory
3. Port already in use
If the required port is already being used, stop the existing application or run the project on another available port.
4. Module not found
Run:
npm install

inside the specific project folder:
backend/
dashboard/
frontend/
